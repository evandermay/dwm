# dwm
Just my build of dwm

The patches I have installed that I remeber: 
* Fullscreen 
* Cool Autostart
* Fibonaci 
* Fullgaps
* Noborder 
* Warp - This works really nicely with xbanish 
* Cycle Layouts 

## Some notes about using this:

It uses scripts I have in .local/bin in the voidrice repo for a lot of things

I'm using betterlockscreen and I like how that works for now

All autostarting for now is done through .xinitrc

I use slstatus for my status bar and I like how that works so far - besides the volume indicator which I'm going to fix soon enough


## To Do:
* Just keep refining, as I have a couple ideas in my head
